		description "The targetNN recognised correctly recognise 
			more than 99% of the training, development and testing 
			data."
		status toBeDiscussed
	}

	
	Weakness weak1 {
		description "Low number of test cases, since we have 2 
			images per equivalence class in average."
		solution "Augment the testing dataset with sufficient 
			variations and at least 5 images per equivalence class."

		description "Recognition problems, if the digit at the ones 
			place is a 0 or 9."
		solution "Augment the training dataset with images that 
			contain a 9 or a 0 at the ones place."

	Weakness weak4 {
		description "Neural networkâ€™s recognition policy (When do we consider that the neural network has recognised some data?)"
		solution "The equivalence class to which an image will be declared to belong to is these ones for which the recognition probability is higher than 0.9."
