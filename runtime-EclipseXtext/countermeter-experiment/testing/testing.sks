Testing test1_1 of CNN after training1 {
	description "The trained convolutional neural network is tested on the testing dataset 
				after the first training of the 1st process iteration. The targetNN takes as 
				input every image and outputs a probability distribution over 2x10 equivalence classes.
				The targetNN's recognized equivalence classes are compared to the expected equivalence classes."
	objectives "The test monitoring data, such as accuracy, loss, confusion matrices and different image grids is generated from the results."
