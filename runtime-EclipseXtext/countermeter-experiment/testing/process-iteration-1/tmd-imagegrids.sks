	description 'We have 5 different grids of images to be verified. These grids are used to analyse the correctly and incorrectly recognised images. 
				Additionally, we use the grids of the raw datasets to visualise the used data for training and testing the targetNN.
				The images show some issues with recognition of state transitions where both digits must be changed in the same time. 
				There are several issues with noisy images.'
